# Image scanning using trivy

Trivy is a fast, simple, and comprehensive security scanner for containers, Kubernetes, and various system components. Developed by Aqua Security, it helps identify vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and secrets in code and infrastructure.

- I have a github actions workflow file which will be triggered by cron job  for every day for Image scanning
