3. Provide a name for the token, check **✅ Write Packages**, and generate the token.
    
4. This token will be used for authentication, allowing **🔐 login, ✍️ write, and 📖 read** access to GitHub Image Registry.

## ⚙️ GitHub Actions Workflows

GitHub Actions workflows should be located in:  
📂 `/.github/workflows/<workflowname.yml>`  
GitHub scans this path and executes workflows based on defined conditions.

- A workflow file named **CICD-main.yml** is created in the SCM repository.
    
- The workflow is triggered whenever a **⬆️ push operation** or **🔀 pull request merge** occurs on the **main** branch.
    
- If changes are made to a **specific microservice**, only that microservice is **🛠️ built and 📦 pushed** to **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)**.
    
- If no relevant changes are detected, the image-building step is **⏭️ skipped**.
    
- Authentication to **GHCR** is handled using **🔐 secrets** (username and password) configured in the repository.

## 🔄 CI/CD Operation

1. **📜 Dummy Push**
    
    - A workflow file modification is pushed to the master branch.
        
    - Since this is a dummy push, **no microservice** is detected, and the **image-building stage is skipped**.

    **📌 Pipeline Status:**

2. **🛠️ Microservice Change Detected**
    
    - A change is made to a microservice folder.
        
    - The workflow detects the change, **🔨 builds the image**, and **🚀 pushes it to GHCR**.
        
    
    **📌 Microservice Detected in Pipeline:**

    **✅ Image Pushed Status:**

    **📦 GHCR Image Registry:**

This setup ensures **⚡ efficient CI/CD automation** using **GitHub Actions**, allowing **only the necessary microservices** to be **built and deployed** when changes are made. 🚀
