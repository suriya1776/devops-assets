# Image scanning using snyk tool

Snyk is a security scanning tool designed to identify and fix vulnerabilities in code, dependencies, containers, and cloud infrastructure. It is widely used in DevSecOps workflows to integrate security into the development process.

- I have a github actions workflow file which will be triggered by cron job  for every day for Image scanning
